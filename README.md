# Robotic Pumps
## What is this?
If you've heard about the pump and dumps schemes on Discord and Telegram you probably know it's quite difficult to the average pumper to profit since the admins already have sell orders ready.  
After seing all these prepumped pumps, I had a thought of what a non-prepumped pump would look like and that's why I created the project Robotic Pumps.    

Robotic Pumps is a Discord group where no one, not even the knows the coin before the pump, which makes the pumps much more fair for everyone.

## What was the result on the pumps we did?
### Our first pump - MRCH/USDT

This was overall the best pump we ever did, it went on for 20 minutes, with the peak being at the 13th minute.

### Our second pump - BFC/USDT

This pump held more than 2 hours and peaked at 300% after 15 minutes, however the pump was a lot more botted.

### Our third pump - GOM/USDT

We had a lot new members and collaborated with some other groups (Shared signal from the fair-bot, no one of the admins knew the coin before) which made the pump very bad. The new people panic sold after the second minute because their sell order didn't go through, and the coin therefore never hit the trending page.  
This was also the first time with the anti-bot mechanism which may have contributed to the lower volumes.  
Many people, including me, lost money on the pump

### Our fourth and last pump - GOGO/USDT

And as we thought it couldn't get worse. This pump was a complete disaster, we only had 13 USDT volume and it made 0% gain. This would be our last pump.

## Why there can't be "fair" pumps
Fair pumping has a major problem, advertising. When you pump there will always be someone left holding the bag, therefore theoretically you are going to lost 50% of your members per pump until there is no one left.  
This was what we saw with Robotic Pumps, our member count peaked at around 1500 members and it went down to about 500.  

## How much I made of the project
This project weren't actually profittable for me, in total I lost about $22, but I don't care about that as it was fun to program the AI, and running the server. 

### Does this mean fair pumping is dead?
No! Absolutely not. 
The original form of pumping is dead. However I am currently working on a platform that's different from anything ever seen before in the pump community and would make pumps more fair for everyone.
